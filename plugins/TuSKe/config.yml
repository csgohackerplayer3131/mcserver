#For example, TuSKe register the type 'InventoryType' for the expression to create inventories
#So, in case the value 'chest' is conflicting with something else, just enable it and
#it will only accept if used like 'InventoryType.CHEST'
#Example:
#	open virtual InventoryType.CHEST inventory with size 1 named "Hi" to player
#Don't need to worry about it, is just in case.
